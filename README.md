  ## Description
  A web application where you can create your very own character and interact with other users' character(s). Users can use this as a repository of their character ideas for future games. Find the [Character Creator here](https://intense-taiga-65507-7eac3b308146.herokuapp.com/). 

  ### User Story
    As a nerd, I want to make fictional game characters so that I can use them as ideas for future games.

  ### MVP Acceptance Criteria
    Given a character creating application:
    - When I reach the landing page, then I am presented with the instructions of the webpage and some character examples.
    - When I click on any of the navbar links (other than Home/Landing Page), I am asked to login or signup.
    After logging in:
    - When I click on the “Character Database”, I see a list of all the characters that all users have made.
    - When I click on a character, I am brought to that specific character’s page.
    - When I click on “Your Characters”, I see a list of all the characters I have created, and a link to create a new character.
    - When I click on one of my characters, I am brought to that specific character’s page. I also have the option to delete or edit the character.
    - When I click on “Create Character”, I am brought a form to fill out information about the character. Once submitted, that character will be added to my character list.

  ### Post MVP
    - Add graphics for selecting character’s physical attributes (head, chest, legs)
    - Add graphics for inventory, allowing users to select up to three items
    - Add graphics for an actual rogue-lite game with that character
    - Search bar to search for characters / filter system to sort and arrange characters
    - Comment system where other users can comment on each other's characters.
    - Character of the Week!
    - Voting between two characters to win the battle
