### User Story
    As a nerd, I want to make fictional game characters so that I can use them as ideas for future games. 

### MVP Acceptance Criteria
    Given a character creating application: 
    - When I reach the landing page, then I am presented with the instructions of the webpage and some character examples. 
    - When I click on any of the navbar links (other than Home/Landing Page), I am asked to login or signup.
    After logging in: 
    - When I click on the “Character Database”, I see a list of all the characters that all users have made. 
    - When I click on a character, I am brought to that specific character’s page. 
    - When I click on “Your Characters”, I see a list of all the characters I have created, and a link to create a new character. 
    - When I click on one of my characters, I am brought to that specific character’s page. I also have the option to delete or edit the character. 
    - When I click on “Create Character”, I am brought a form to fill out information about the character. Once submitted, that character will be added to my character list.
